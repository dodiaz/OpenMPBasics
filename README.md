# OpenMPBasics

This code was created in Visual Studio with the bulk of the coding that I did in the script called Basics.cpp in the OpenMPBasics folder. I've included some instructions in the first big commented region of the code on how to make it so that Visual Studio knows it will be using OpenMP.

What is OpenMP? It's an application programming interface (API) what allows you to parallelize your code. OpenMP essentially allows you to access multiple processors on your device at the same time and potentially speed up your code. But be careful because sometimes the parallelizing actually slows down your code.
